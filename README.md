## FEATURES:

- This is a web3-based shooting game that follows a P2E protocol built using Unity and Chainsafe gaming SDK.
- In the game, the currency is an ERC20 token named Mirai token (MRI in short). All players are given 20 MRI tokens when they connect with the game for the first time using a Web3 wallet.
- 10 MRI tokens are needed to play a match. Players can buy MRI tokens from the shop.
- Inside the game, players can choose between any two guns and use them to destroy randomly generated targets to score points. If the points they scored are their highest points then they will be updated on the leaderboard on the website.
- Every day at 12 am, the leaderboard gets a reset and the top three winners are given ETH as a reward as well as a chance to mint an awesome NFT which will be generated randomly.
- Finally, there is also a DEMO mode where players don't need to pay anything to play. In this mode, they can hone their skills and master the game mechanics.
